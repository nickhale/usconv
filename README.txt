These codes reproduce the results in HALE, NICHOLAS - AN ULTRASPHERICAL SPECTRAL 
METHOD FOR LINEAR FREDHOLM AND VOLTERRA INTEGRO-DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF 
CONVOLUTION TYPE.

The code relies on 
 * chebvals2legcoeffs() and ultra2ultra() from Chebfun 
   (https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun)
 * breakaxis()
   (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3668-breakaxis)
 * alignfigs() 
   (https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun)
although the last two are used only for nice formatting of the results.
